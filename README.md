# Autocomplete & Autocorrect NLP

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a lightweight **Autocomplete and Autocorrect system** using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to demonstrate how text prediction and spelling correction can be built using statistical language models and string similarity algorithms.

The implementation is intentionally kept **simple, stable, and dependency-free**, making it suitable for academic submissions, internships, and beginner-friendly learning.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform text preprocessing and tokenization
* Build an n-gram language model for autocomplete
* Implement autocorrect using edit distance
* Analyze word frequency patterns
* Visualize key insights from the dataset

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **Dataset Used:** Credit Card Fraud Dataset (`creditcard.csv`)
* Since the dataset does not contain natural language text, it is converted into a **synthetic text corpus** for demonstrating NLP techniques.

> Note: The focus of this project is NLP methodology, not fraud detection.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* Regular Expressions (re)
* Collections module

(No external NLP libraries used)

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. Load and convert dataset into text format
2. Clean and tokenize text data
3. Build a trigram-based autocomplete model
4. Implement autocorrect using edit distance
5. Generate predictions and corrections
6. Visualize most frequent tokens

---

## 📊 Features

* Autocomplete word suggestions
* Spelling correction for mistyped words
* Lightweight tokenizer implementation
* Frequency-based correction logic
* Simple bar chart visualization

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure `creditcard.csv` is in the project directory
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## ✅ Output

* Corrected sentences from user input
* Autocomplete word suggestions
* Visualization of most frequent tokens

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how core NLP concepts like autocomplete and autocorrect can be implemented from scratch using Python. It emphasizes stability, clarity, and reproducibility, making it ideal for learning and showcasing foundational NLP skills.
